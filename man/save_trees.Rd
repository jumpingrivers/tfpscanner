  n_leaves,
  output_dir,
  output_format = c("rds", "html"),
  include_date = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_list}{List of \code{ggtree} objects. The "noninteractive" and "interactive"
entries will be saved to an external file. As generated by \code{create_trees}.}

\item{branch_col}{Scalar string. The name of the statistic that is under study here (e.g.,
"logistic_growth_rate" or "clock_outlier"). This name will be used in the output file paths.}

\item{n_leaves}{Scalar integer. The number of leaves in the tree.}

\item{output_dir}{Scalar string. The directory where the plots will be saved.}

\item{output_format}{String (either \code{rds} or \code{html} or both). Default: both. Which
file format(s) should the interactive tree plot(s) be placed? For \code{rds}, a \code{ggtree}
object will be placed in an \code{rds} file. For \code{html}, a \code{htmlwidget} will be
placed in a \code{html} file.}

\item{include_date}{Boolean. Should the file-paths include the current date?}
